# DogWalking

DogWalking is a responsive web app built with PHP and Javascript. This website was built as a marketing tool for a dog walking/sitting company. 

# Image Gallery
One of the most notable features is a dynamic image gallery that repopulates every time the parent article is opened. To properly display these images, this website takes advantage of the fslightbox.js library.

# Contact Form
The contact form was developed with PHP's PHPMailer library using an external SMTP server. The form leverages AJAX to submit the contact request seamlessly and intuitively as well as displaying any mailing error codes to the client.

# Disclaimer
This website is based from a template found on the web. Below are the original creators' comments about the template:
	This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized "pages"
	and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
	responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
	Hope you dig it :)
