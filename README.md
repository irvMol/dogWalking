# DogWalking

DogWalking is a responsive web app built with PHP and JS. This website was built as a marketing tool for a dog wallking/sitting company. One of the most notable features is a dynamic image gallery that repopulates every time it is opened. To view these images, this website takes advantage of the fslightbox.js library. The contact form was developed with PHP's phpailer library using an external SMTP server.
