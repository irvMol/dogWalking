# DogWalking

DogWalking is a responsive web app built with PHP and JavaScript. This site was built as a marketing tool for a dog walking/sitting company. 

## Image Gallery
	
One of the most notable features is a dynamic image gallery that repopulates every time the parent article is opened. To properly display these images, this site takes advantage of the fslightbox.js library.

## Contact Form
	
The contact form was developed with PHP's PHPMailer library using an external SMTP server. The form leverages Ajax to submit the contact request seamlessly and intuitively as well as displaying any mailing error codes to the client.

## Disclaimer
	
This site is based from a template found on the web. Below are the original creators' comments about the template:
    This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized "pages"
    and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
    responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
    Hope you dig it :)

## Resources

These are some resources I found helpful while creating this project. If you want to build something similar and don't know where to start, skim these resources alongside the dogWalking source code.
